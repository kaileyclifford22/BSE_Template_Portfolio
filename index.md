This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was creating a simple one-person pong game using processing.I first created the image of the ball, then programmed it to be able to move and react with the wall. I then created a "wall" to function as the other player in the game. I then created the image of the paddle and programmed it's movement. Finally, I made the ball speed up with every play, so that the game would continuously become more challenging.
