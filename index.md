<B>Arduino Pong </B> <BR>
This is a pong game created in processing. It is connected to Arduino, and the paddles are then controlled by potentiometers.

# Reflection
This project was a learning experience for me. This was my first time ever working with Processing, Arduino, and circuitry and I believe I got a great introduction to all of these things.I also learned alot about what I enjoy in the field of engineering and what I want to pursue. I really enjoyed learning how to use and working with Processing,and I believe that the creativity allowed by the artistic nature of this coding language was crucial to this. I did struggle a lot with working with Arduino IDE, as it  was incredibly difficult for me to debug and understand. I did plan on creating a selection screen for my game, but unfortunately ran out of time and could not. I loved working on this project and hope to continue working with these elements.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was creating the exterior controls for my pong game. I began by adding Arduino controls that were connected to Processing. I then began working on the hardware portion of this project. I wired my arduino board to two potentiometers using a breadboard and jumper wires. I struggled with learning to use Arduino  software during this portion, as well as learning how to use the potentiometers and wiring.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was creating a simple one-person pong game using processing. I first created the image of the ball, then programmed it to be able to move and react with the wall. I then created a "wall" to function as the other player in the game. I then created the image of the paddle and programmed it's movement. Finally, I made the ball speed up with every play, so that the game would continuously become more challenging.
