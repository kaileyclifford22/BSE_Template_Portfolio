<B>Arduino Pong </B> <BR>
This is a pong game created in processing. It is connected to Arduino, and the paddles are then controlled by potentiometers.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was creating the exterior controls for my pong game. I began by adding Arduino controls that were connected to Processing. I then began working on the hardware portion of this project. I wired my arduino board to two potentiometers using a breadboard and jumper wires. I struggled with learning to use Arduino  software during this portion, as well as learning how to use the potentiometers and wiring.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was creating a simple one-person pong game using processing. I first created the image of the ball, then programmed it to be able to move and react with the wall. I then created a "wall" to function as the other player in the game. I then created the image of the paddle and programmed it's movement. Finally, I made the ball speed up with every play, so that the game would continuously become more challenging.
